## The idea
Combining with the well-known fable "The Little Prince", we present a quantum online board game allowing quantum novices play together during the pandemic!

(This game was devleoped during the Qiskit Fall Fest Hachathon and was selected as Second Place award among 6 other projects in the [Taiwan SQCS Quantum Hackathon, 2021](https://qiskitfallfest.hypeinnovation.com/servlet/hype/IMT?documentTableId=396317851979055264&userAction=Browse&templateName=&documentId=1a0c3bc2a3e054f2f9fcce91f3584020))

## The issue description
As the fundamental building block for quantum information science, the idea of Quantum Circuits language is usually confusing for beginners.
To promote the idea of quantum circuit and let players practice through playing and during the pandemics, we aimed to design a board-game which allows players to compete online with each other by solving quantum circuits which maps to given quantum state set.

## Our proposal
Kids love games, and in this game we adopted the game mechanism from the well-known Monopoly game with the aim that global audiences are more familiar with.
To make this game suitable to play with adolescents and adults alike, we derived our story line from the fable "The Little Prince".

## Rule 101
The players are going to collect quantum logic gates (X, H, CX gates) from the monopoly-like game map to put together some quantum circuits which generate the given challenge quantum state set (|000> + |011>, for example). The player will be rewarded with a rose when solved a challenge, and the first player who collected 5 roses will be the winner!

## Looking for feedbacks!
Simple as it firstly looks like, the rule and map of this game have been tested and modified extensively to balance and improve playing experience. From the amount of gates on the map, various fortune/chance cards serve as useful (and sometimes surprise!) tools to assist competition, and also the winning condition of rose scores are carefully chosen after our thorough tests. This game is, nevertheless, still under testing and we would like to hear everyone's comment to make it more fun and even competitive. Please try it out and give us some thoughts/feedbacks!
